CAESAR CIPHER ALGORITHM

This task involves implementing a simple Caesar Cipher in Python. A type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.The cipher is one of th oldest and simplest forms of encryption, named after Julius Caesar, who is stated to have used it as a form of communications with his generals.This task's requirement is creating a program that can both encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.


FEATURES:Encryption-shift the letters of a plaintext message by a specified number of positions to generate a cipher text.
Decryption:Reverse the process by shifting the cipher text back  to it's original positions to recover the plaintext.


CUSTOM SHIFT VALUE:Allow the user to specify the number of positions each letter should be shifted.


REQUIREMENTS:Python 3.x:Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.


INSTALLATION

1.Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Jewel326/caesar_cipher.git

2.Navigate to the project directory: cd caesar_cipher.py

3.Run the script:If you have python installed,you can directly run the script using: python caesar_cipher.py

USAGE:You can use the caesar cipher script to either encrypt or decrypt messages.

1.Encryption:To encrypt a message, run the scripts and follow the prompts to enter your message and the shift value:

Enter the message:HelloWorld

Enter the shift value:4, 

The program will output the encrypted message:

LippsAsvph

2.Decryption:To decrypt a message.provide the encrypted message and the same shift value:

Enter the message to decrypt:LippsAsvph

Enter the shift value: 4

The program will output the original plaintext message:HelloWorld.



EXAMPLE:

Here's an example of how to use the Caesar Cipher:

Enter the message to encrypt:CaesarCipher

Enter the shift value: 3

OUTPUT:FdhvduF1skhu

To decrypt:

Enter the message :FdhvduF1skhu

Enter the shift value: 3

OUTPUT:CaesarCipher

Tip:Note that the Caesar Cipher typically only shifts letters, so make sure non-alphabetic characters like spaces, punctuation, and numbers remain unchanged.
